    <string name="description_txt">Doomfist is a close-combat fighter who excels in taking down enemy targets with his combos. With his signature ability Rocket Punch, he can secure an instant kill on a non-tank hero by knocking them into a wall. Rising Uppercut not only deals damage but also enables Doomfist to secure higher ground. Seismic Slam is another dual-purpose ability that both provides additional mobility and deals damage based on time spent in the air. After casting Meteor Strike, Doomfist becomes invulnerable while choosing his landing location and then drops down, dealing damage in a large area. The Best Defense... helps him to mitigate punishment from the enemy team as long as he can continue dealing damage. While Doomfist is strong up close, his damage falls off at mid- to long-range. Unless he can close the distance between himself and an enemy, his only option is to use Hand Cannon, which typically is better used as a finisher than as a primary weapon due to its long reload time and relatively low damage. Doomfist is a high-risk, high-reward hero - while his large burst damage can be used to easily pick off high-priority targets, he typically takes more damage than other heroes due to his large hitbox.</string>
